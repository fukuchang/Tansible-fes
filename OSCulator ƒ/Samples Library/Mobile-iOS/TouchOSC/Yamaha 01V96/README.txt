How to use:
-----------

1. Upload the layout
Use TouchOSC Editor on your Mac to add the layout to TouchOSC on your iPhone

2. Configure TouchOSC
- Make sure your iPhone/iPod is connected to the same network as your Mac.
- Launch the provided OSCulator file and on your iPhone/iPod, launch TouchOSC.
- In TouchOSC Settings page, go to Network.  At the bottom, click on the line that refers to "OSCulator".  This will tell TouchOSC to send data to OSCulator on your computer.
- Go back to the Settings page, go to the Layout page.  Select the layout you have just uploaded.  Go back.
- Click done to launch the layout.


3. Configure the MIDI routing

If you are using OSCulator 2.9.6 you will need an application like MIDI Pipe or MIDI Patchbay to divert OSCulator's MIDI output to your physical MIDI interface output.

If you are using the latest version of OSCulator:
- go in the Parameters Window, then click on the I/O tab.
- In the "Select active MIDI Outputs" drop down menu, enable your physical MIDI Output where the 01V96 is connected.
